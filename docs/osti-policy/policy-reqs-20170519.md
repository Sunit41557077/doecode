#  20170519 Policy Meeting
**Date: May 19, 2017**

**Time: 10:03 a.m. - 10:58 a.m.**

**Agenda:**
1. Submission workflow for Alpha and Beta release
2. Questions for Legal Team
3. Updates
4. IP Council Meeting

**Proceedings:**
1.	The meeting began with a question concerning submission requirements for ‘published’ and ‘submitted’ software. Requiring the same metadata for both might discourage use overall. The team proposed that the number of required fields (for published projects) decrease (i.e. URL to repo or landing page, abstract, developer, license, and title).   
  
     The team also discussed the possibility of assigning a DOI for published and submitted works, as another incentive for use.   
 
     Next, the workflow for the alpha release was discussed. The team conferred on the details and described a workflow where, developers submit a project, which creates a 241.4 record, and generates a link to the landing page in SciTech (after submission to E-link and release by OSTI).  

     They discussed types of acceptable software and their use case; unlimited software, open or closed source, will be accepted. It was confirmed that the source code would determine distribution. Channels for distribution will only incorporate source code uploads from a URL or landing page; use of CDs will not be an option.   

   
     The team expressed concern with changes to submissions requirements for labs unfamiliar with the process. It was suggested that a meeting with STIP representatives occur during the upcoming data workshop.   

    
     Various use cases for licensing and distribution of software packages were discussed.   

     For the beta release, developers will submit projects to DOE Code, a 241.1 record will then be created, and a link to the repo or landing page will be added to SciTech after release by a Releasing Official. This will ultimately do away with the software center.  The goal is to make the process similar to other STI (AMs, tech reports, etc.) so that OSTI is not responsible for releasing except in the case where OSTI must act as Releasing Official; this is still to be determined.   


2.	Particulars, in anticipation of the Legal Team meeting, were discussed. The team decided that they will work through use cases where, 1) A lab is asserting copyright and distribution of software and for the archived copy OSTI provides, determine which license guides distribution 2) Submissions have no license 3) A license is needed for re-distribution of existing legacy binaries. 

    To accommodate the demands of the project, the DOE Code project will consult other resources. Assistance from a student, specializing in digital archaeology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville will work with the DOE Code to audit and preserve legacy binaries.   
 
3.	Members of the Policy Team are working on a revision of the DOE Code Product Plan, help text, and definitions. The technical team is working on the dark archive, UIs and user authentication.

4.	Details from the IP council meeting were discussed. They raised questions regarding the logo and requirements for supercomputing code.
