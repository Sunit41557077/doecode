# 20170512 DOE Code Dissemination Meeting
**Date: May 12, 2017**

**Time: 2:10 p.m. - 2:35 p.m.**

**Agenda**
1. DOE Code interface (look and feel)
2. Product Plan

**Proceedings:**
1.	The meeting began with a question regarding the DOE Code interface.  Questions concerning the discovery tool’s look and feel were posed, including details on who might be developing front versus backend features. It was decided that SciTech Connect should be the starting place for design. Existing wireframes in the DOE Code repository will also serve as a place of reference for design elements.  
   
      After a mockup or ‘rock’ is developed, then the developers will discuss feasibility measures in time for the September deadline. The team decided on a date for a finalized version of the mockup in early July.  
   
      Specifics on the pages, major tabs, and metadata filters were discussed. The team decided to consult previous mockups as a base consideration for future frameworks, some pages include the splash page, search results, software profile page, and user page. 

2.	The product plan must incorporate considerations from the technical team as it is under revision. The current plan will be reviewed and discussed at a meeting next week in anticipation of edits.
