**Date: January 6, 2017**

**Time: 1:30 p.m. – 2:00 p.m.**

**Agenda:**

1.	Announcements 
2.	Metadata Application Profile

**Proceedings:**

1.	The first part of the meeting was spent giving announcements to the team. There will be a briefing to the OSTI director at the end of the month. One goal for this is to have version two of the metadata sent out on the Friday before the meeting, giving three weeks to complete. There was metadata feedback given for version one of the metadata. A few team members will look at these first and then pass to the team for feedback. The last announcement given to the policy team was that the technical team is going to start writing code, testing web frameworks, and show off requirements with a prototype by the end of the month. 

2.	Next, the first draft of the metadata application profile was presented to the rest of the team. This profile includes namespaces, established vocabularies, a proposed six classes, elements and more. The full metadata application profile can be viewed [here](https://github.com/doecode/doecode/blob/master/metadata-schema/metadata_application_profile.md). A [sample json]( https://github.com/doecode/doecode/blob/master/metadata-schema/exampleJSON.json) file that shows namespaces and classes with properties using the same parameters as the application profile was also presented. It was mentioned that members of the team should have a meeting to tighten up the language for the profile. The format of the ‘Date’ field was briefly discussed and suggested to provide a format within the metadata application profile to give a standard to work toward. It was also suggested that the policy team be thinking of a test problem to give to the technical team to showcase how the metadata would be beneficial in solving the problem.
