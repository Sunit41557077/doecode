#20170310 Policy Meeting  

**Date: March 10, 2017**

**Time: 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.**

**Agenda:**

1.	Updates
2.	Licenses/access limitations info
3.	DOE Code wizard mockups

**Proceedings:**

1.	Since it had been awhile since the Policy team had a meeting, the first part of the meeting was spent giving updates on some behind-the-scenes working taking place. These include the creation of the YAML file, DOI registration, separation of front & back end, contract number validations, and installing the DOE Code infrastructure on AWS. 

2.	The project lead wanted to share information gathered by legal on licenses and access limitations. Suggestions that have been made are for the ESTSC license go away since technically this would be relicensing, that some older codes may retain this ESTSC license, to offer under multiple licenses if a lab is not asserting copyright, etc. It was suggested that a meeting be scheduled with another member to ensure she is comfortable with this direction. 

3.	The largest portion of the meeting was spent walking through DOE Code wizard mockups and obtaining feedback from the team. It was brought up that this would be too difficult to use and was suggested that moving to a non-linear form would work better. This would allow a user to fill out any section(s) they choose and save, then return at a later time to complete sections until all have been filled out and validated. Once all sections are validated, it can be completed (published or submitted). Another suggestion made was to move fields such as B&R code and FWP number to the same area of the form where other funding information is located vs. having funding information spread across different screens. 

**Actions:**

 - Review metadata schema for changes that need to be made, paying specific attention to organizations and funding identifiers
