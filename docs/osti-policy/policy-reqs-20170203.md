#20170203 Policy Meeting – Metadata Discussion 

**Date: February 3, 2017**

**Time: 10:30 a.m. – 11:00 a.m.**

**Agenda:**

1.	Share information about licensing and copyright 
2.	Address couple of metadata items
3.	Look at issues on GitHub

**Proceedings:**

1.	The first part of the meeting was spent sharing some information obtained from a member of the legal team. One issue discussed was regarding new and existing codes that never assert copyright and options for dealing with this. At this time, the legal team is still investigating other licensing questions from the DOE Code team. 

2.	The team discussed a few metadata items. Versioning seems to be structured well in the metadata application profile, however more conversations about this need to be had in technical meetings. The Developers/Creators metadata field has been resolved in the application profile. It was proposed that a policy team member create DataCite mapping for the metadata. Also, it was decided that the current metadata field, Rights/Licenses/Legal Notices/Disclaimers, will be separated into 4 individual fields. These will all be mandatory with ‘None’ being an acceptable entry.

3.	The last portion of the meeting was spent reviewing the open ‘metadata’ issues on GitHub. Updates were made to some that have had progress or changes made, and ones that have been completed were closed. 

**Actions:**

-	Create DataCite mapping for metadata
