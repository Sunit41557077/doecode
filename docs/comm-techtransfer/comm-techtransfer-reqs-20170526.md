#  20170526 Technology Transfer Meeting

**Date: May 26, 2017**

**Time: 10 a. m. â€“ 11: a. m.**

**Agenda:**
1.	DOE Code overview and impact
2.	Questions and Answers

**Proceedings:**

This was a meeting to explore possibilities for DOE Code and Office of Technology Transitions collaboration.  Attendees explained their roles and responsibilities in their respective positions at OTI and OTT. There was a new group member who explained his background in data modeling and analysis, and with EERE.

1.	The DOE Code team provided a high-level overview of DOE Code, emphasizing how the open source movement has impacted software development and practices, necessitating the need for a different model than ESTSC.   
  Someone from the team expressed how surprised they were that ESTSC was not better known, questioning why we would build a new software center rather than look to commercial products or companies for the solution.   
  The DOE Code team explained how OSTI provides unique expertise in building STI archival solutions, and described the requirements for a DOE software center.  No one commercial service would accommodate their needs.  Also, part of this effort is to build a community that will provide ongoing contributions to development.   

2.	There were other questions posed about the metadata, qualitative descriptors, content, and taxonomy that the DOE Code will employ.  The DOE Code team members explained the modernized 241.1 and the basis for all required elements.  They also provided the location of the metadata folder, Github.com/doecode/doecode, where the metadata application profile could be viewed.   
  Later, a group member emphasized the importance of collaboration.  

**Conclusions/ Actions:**
A meeting will be scheduled for next Friday for a detailed discussion of slides with team members.
