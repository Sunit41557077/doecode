**Proceedings:**

1.	The goal of this meeting was to get thoughts from the team on a few questions pertaining to software copyright and distribution. The DOE Code team has spoken with the tech transfer community about this prior to this meeting and wanted to get the labs’ input as well before determining a path forward. For a scenario where OSTI would be required to serve as an alternative distribution channel (catastrophic case where laboratories shut down), it was asked how OSTI should respond for the distribution of software. The team felt that for open source, OSTI should keep the license it was released under instead of reevaluating. For closed source, it was advised to go through and find if software is exclusively licensed to someone else. It was mentioned that during the ‘handover’ that the current status for the terms or distribution related to the software should be provided. The team was then asked what to do in a case where there is no exclusive license in place and had been kept close source but does not need to stay that way. The team replied that the default position is that it is in the public domain, to restrict public domain distribution permissions to copyright five year period, and if the five year permission has lapsed, there is no license to assign – no restrictions.   

    Next, the team was presented with a case where software is submitted with no license. Developers sometimes do not consider putting a license on software and there is a special case that was mentioned by the tech transfer team where developers can’t put a license on software because of the nature of some sponsors (would reveal support from sponsor). The teams’ thoughts on this were as default, with no license, it’s in the public domain except in commercialization cases. It was mentioned here that one goal for DOE Code is to get where the lab point-of-contact is notified once software is submitted and then they can go through the copyright assertion process.  
   
    The last question asked was about legacy binaries. ESTSC includes over 3500 packages, many that are only available as binary executables. Often, packages from this collection are requested that are decades old. The question was asked under what license OSTI should redistribute these existing legacy binaries when original copyright holders are no longer in business. Currently, OSTI redistributes under an ESTSC license, but the DOE Code team does not have plans to continue handling it that way. The only suggestion made was to have a lawyer evaluate each package to see if license attached, determine copyright holder, etc., though this would take significant time and resources.   
   
    Overall, the labs-legal team provided new things to think about regarding copyright and distribution of software for these cases. The team expressed interest in getting together either via workshop or teleconference with other legal counsel and the tech transfer community to work through these issues and develop a path forward.
