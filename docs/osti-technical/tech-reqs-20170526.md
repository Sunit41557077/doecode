# 20170526 Technical Meeting

**Date: May 26, 2017**

**Time: 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.**

**Agenda:**
1.	Archive and Front End Updates
2.	UI (DOE Code-registered DOIs)
3.	Authentication 
4.	Security 

**Proceedings:** 

1.	Progress made on the dark archive was presented. It was decided that work on front-end changes would resume next week. 
2.	It was determined that the best choice for DOI resolution was to use a servlet, the same concept that OSTI employs for tech reports, using the same prefix, resolving to osti.gov/doecode/id, then redirecting out to a repository.  Using this method, the DOE Code team does not have to worry about knowing multiple, pre-registered domains. Amazon Web Services were note reviewed this week.
3.	There was discussion about behind-the-scenes authentication and there are plans to look at some of the code worked on related to login, encryption, cookies, etc.  The team decided that there might need to more mock-up wireframes for username/password functionalities.
4.	There was extensive discussion about security key handling.  It was determined they should not put the algorithm for our security key on GitHub.  It was also determined that the default should be self-signed SSL.  The team discussed possible issues with cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and possible security scenarios.
