# 20170310 Technical Meeting

**Date: March 10, 2017**

**Time: 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.**

**Proceedings:**

The meeting began with discussing the upcoming deadline on April 1st (Internal Release of Metadata Capture User Interface – Encompasses DOE Code User Interface for metadata submission. Supports transmission of finalized metadata to E-Link triggering DOE STI workflow). There are 15 working days to meet this deadline. The team went over things that are missing that have to happen in order to meet the deadline. A bulleted list of these will be emailed out and turned into issues in the GitHub repository. Since the Policy team suggested moving things around a bit for the wizard, the metadata schema will be reviewed and decided on what should change. These changes will be discussed with the metadata librarian assisting with the project. Next, the team discussed the plan for taking away the concept of linearity for the wizard and working on updating the wireframes in the future. Lastly, it was suggested that there be security discussions soon. This will be added to the next technical meeting’s agenda.
