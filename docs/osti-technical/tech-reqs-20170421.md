**Agenda:**

1.	Next steps

**Proceedings:**

1.	The meeting began with discussing the next steps for development. One developer will continue to tweak the form and also switch focus to accounts. The other lead developer will shift focus to GitLab (2nd GitLab is about to be installed). A meeting has been scheduled for May 12th to discuss the dissemination side of development. When starting to work on authentication, it was suggested to look for an authentication model to use before writing a new one, then customizing it to fit the needs of DOE Code. 

2.	The meeting ended with talking about things to look into and start thinking about. These included: find UI testing framework, look into continuous integration, autopopulating ‘License’ & ‘Contributing Organizations’ fields, externalizing strings, and creating a link (short-circuit link) to auto generate metadata template. These should all be added as new issues on GitHub. 

**Actions:**

-	Find UI testing framework
-	Look into Continuous Integration
-	Autopopulate ‘License’ and ‘Contributing Organizations’
-	Externalize strings
