# 20170524 Legal Team Meeting

**Date: May 24, 2017**

**Time: 10:00 a.m. – 10:45 a.m.**

**Agenda:**

Go over three questions from the DOE Code team with legal team to get guidance and formulate answers

**Proceedings:**

The meeting began with reading through the first scenario/question (Work through use case where a lab is asserting copyright and distributing the software, provides OSTI an archive copy. Then lab stops providing software and OSTI now needs to brighten archive. What license is this made available under?). One member of the legal team began to check to see if there was direct guidance on this. It was expressed that this scenario would be for open source, not publically available software or closed source where the lab is handling the distribution and for some catastrophic reason the lab closes or shuts down and is no longer able to distribute software. After some discussion, the legal team’s initial thoughts on this would be to push back to the lab and keep the responsibility to the labs. It was suggested to also consider the case expectation when a lab ceases commercialization for code and hands over rights to DOE.  In addition, it was mentioned that we need to come away with something to replace the ESTSC license. 

This led into the second question/scenario from the DOE Code team (In the case where something is submitted and no license is available, then the idea is that there will be a default set of existing licenses that will be applied and the code made open source. What is that default set of licenses?). It was pointed out that the answer to this question may be the answer to the first, as well. A team member said that we could come up with a DOE specific license but that there may be several, open-source licenses out there already that may define what we need. It was noted that changes may require an updating IPI open-source software. A suggestion was made at this time to have 4-5 lawyers to define a default set of licenses to get behind. Members of the DOE Code team then proposed to set up a meeting with our existing laboratory-legal team along with the commercialization team to get their feedback on the questions and default set of licenses. The scenarios and questions are complex and getting the laboratories input is important. An initial meeting will be set up with the problems clearly defined in a white paper and then, based on feedback, a subsequent phone call will be set up or if needed, a longer event (web conference).
