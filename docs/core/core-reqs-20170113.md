#20170113 Core Team Meeting

**Date: January 13, 2017**

**Time: 11:30 a.m. â€“ 12:00 p.m.**

**Agenda:**

The purpose of the meeting was to present the metadata application schema to a member of the core team to ensure it was well-aligned with the code.gov effort. 

**Proceedings:**

The first draft of the metadata application profile was presented. This profile includes namespaces, established vocabularies, a proposed six classes, elements and more. The full metadata application profile can be viewed [here]( https://github.com/doecode/doecode/blob/master/metadata-schema/metadata_application_profile.md). Conversations followed discussing fields that are present in the code.gov metadata that are not present in the DOE Code metadata. Overall, the DOE Code metadata is well-aligned with code.gov. The core team member will read through the application profile in more detail and update the cardinality of a few fields. The DOE Code team will proceed to share the metadata application profile with the rest of the DOE Code Core team and gather feedback from them.
